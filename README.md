## Project Details
### Project Description
I will be undertaking project topic #2 which is the MyDiscussionForum website. This will be a website designed to be a platform for online discussion, similar to Reddit. Registered users will be allowed to create their own subcommunity section, submit posts, make comments on posts, and edit posts/comments. Unregistered users will simply be able to view said posts and discussions, and are not allowed to submit posts or comments. 

### Requirements List
* New users are able to register for an account
* Registered users are able to:
    * Submit posts (can be text, links to images, videos, social media posts)
    * Make comments
    * Edit their own posts/comments
* Unregistered users are able to view content but are not able to do anything else
* Moderation system where the user that created the subcommunity is able to moderate the content posted.
